# FFAMod
ROUNDS mod that makes the game a free-for-all for offline and online play. Can play with up to 4 people.

Everyone must use this mod with the BepInEx modloader dependency adapted to ROUNDS by Willis in order for it to work.

If you are hosting the server, set the maximum player limit in the main menu before you create the room by hitting 2, 3, or 4 on the top row of your keyboard. By default it is set to 4. It must be equal to the amount of players that will join the lobby.

If you want to play offline with bots, go to the selection screen in Versus mode and press B until you have the amount of bots you want. You can also set the amount of bots you want using the method for the online mode as well. You can also add in as many as you want in the Sandbox mode during the game.
